Usage: 
python dgt_converter_lxml.py <path to directory containing tmx files>

Input: 
.tmx file
Output: 
.csv, .csvw, .rdf 

Description: 
Should be run over a directory of TMX files. The script should also convert any tmx file inside nested directories.

The CSV files are created from the TMX files using predefined headers.
LXML is used to parse the TMX file. 
The script uses a dictionary as a template for the CSVW file.
Once the CSV and CSVW files are created, they are passed to the RDF_FROM_CSVW script which generated an rdf file.
